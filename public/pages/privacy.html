                makes no
                representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results,

                corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
                representation or
                warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
                information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
                uninterrupted or
                error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
                through
                the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of

            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
                statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
                You. But
                in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
                extent
                enforceable under applicable law.</p>

                We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information, which may
                include your (i) IP address; (ii) unique cookie identifier, cookie information and information on

                Third parties may also collect information via Platform through cookies, third party plug-ins and

                is subject to their own privacy policies.

                We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers’ usage of the Platform and to understand our

                aggregate data about Platform traffic and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that
                we can improve our Platform. There are generally three categories of cookies used on our Platform:</p>
            <p>Functional: These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always enabled.
                These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Platform within a single
                session or, if you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping bag and checkout
                process possible as well as assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.
                Performance: These cookies allow us to improve our Platform’s functionality by tracking usage. In some
                cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember
                site preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored recommendations
                and slow site performance.</p>
