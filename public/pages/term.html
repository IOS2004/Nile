                If you live in any of the following countries or regions, additional terms may apply to you and are
                viewable at the bottom of these Terms. We display the country/region within the Terms when applicable.
                These additional terms override the Terms below to the extent of any inconsistency.
            </p>
            <P>Welcome to the Nile community! You are reading these Terms because you are using a Nile website, digital
                experience, social media platform, mobile app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or
                services, all of which are part of Nile’s Platform (“Platform”). You may access the Platform through a
                computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”. Your
                carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</P>
            <p>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and Nile and its affiliates (which we may
                refer to as “Nile,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform. Please review our List of
                Local Entities for the name of the Nile entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the

                        Our Terms May Change. Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer
                        terms,
                        so this paragraph may not apply to you. [See Canada terms.] We may update these Terms from time
                        to time.
                        If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification.

                        through any changes, and if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform. If you
                        continue to
                        use our Platform after we notify you of changes, you will be deemed to have accepted the updated
